### What is a*(aStar)?

[a*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) is a [pathfinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding) algorithem, can be seen as an extensions to [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm).

I implemented the algorithem using [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), Via the module [Pygame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygame).

I wrote two implementations of the algorithem, one as a text-base, and the other as a [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface).
